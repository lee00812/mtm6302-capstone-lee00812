Report

The purpose of this project was to create a web application that allows users to browse and select Pokemon, display their abilities, and save their selections to local storage.

Design decisions 

For a better user experience, all elements are displayed on the screen in a horizontal approach from the desktop perspective. Users could view the first 20 pokemon on the right grid. By clicking the load more button, the next 20 pokemon will be loaded on the same page. Once the user has selected the pokemon, specific information about that pokemon will appear on the top left grid with an image and description. Users could indicate a pokemon as caught by clicking the caught button, that pokemon will appear under the caught list. The release button allows the user to release a pokemon from the caught list to the uncaught list. 

Mobile responsive

For the mobile version, the layout has shifted to a virtual perspective. Same to the above idea, once the user has selected a pokemon, specific information will be shown on the top display grid. Then, the caught list will be shown at the following grid. Finally, the first 20 uncaught pokemon will be displayed on the bottom. 

About creating the prototype

The mobile first approach has been used for this prototype, meaning that the mobile version was created first following by the desktop version. Bootstraps has been implemented in the codes to add more styles to the website. To accommodate for different devices, and different screensize, the desktop version has been created with different widths to ensure a better user experience. However, without the javascript, no images or content can be displayed. For now, Lorem ipsum and FPO boxes have been used until the javascript is implemented.

HMTL & CSS 

HTML and CSS serve as the foundation for building a website, providing a clear and easy-to-follow structure. This part was direct and easy to manage.

API Integration

The PokeAPI was used to retrieve Pokemon data, including abilities and images, and to display this data in the application. This is challenging because we didn't spend much time in class to understand about connecting API. However, with the guidance of our professor, we were able to successfully implement this feature within a few days. 

Interactive Scripts

JavaScript was used to add interactive functionality to the application, including the ability to select and display Pokemon, and to store and retrieve selections in local storage. This proved to be the most challenging aspect of the project, as it required us to demonstrate all of the skills we had acquired throughout the semester. With the assistance of SPA and David, I was able to complete this portion of the project within two weeks.
